###### What students say about this program:  

> The training was superb and I genuinely enjoyed every moment of it. The content was extremely informative and incredibly useful. I have attended several workshops and training classes before but I can't recall any of them having such a strong impact. You have done a wonderful job and I appreciate your efforts.  
> Now if I want to learn a new programming language what I do is try to find a solution to a problem and code in the language I want to learn and this made me *learn new programming languages in no time*.  
> -- *Vinay Godaba*

> The real thing which made me come to the classes is the eye-opening real-life scenarios that you used to share with us. 
> I came to know that the programming language is not a big issue when you have the logic and *Universal Algorithmic design style*.  
> -- *Gireesh Kumar Yejju*

> Now, I can say myself as a fearless coder *who can code in any language*.  
> -- *P.V.Sai Srinivas*

> After these classes, I now have *three completely documented mini-projects* on GitHub, I'm now a Developer Student Club Lead and organized three workshops and one programming competition.   
> -- *Sai Sampath*

> One of the main parts of your training was not to concentrate on the tool and programming language instead concentrate on problem-solving which had a *great impact on my thinking*.
